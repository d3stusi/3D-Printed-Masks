This is the original Montana Mask

Printer Settings
Material: PLA  
Nozzle Size: 0.4 mm  
Walls: 2-3  
Nozzle Temp: 200  
Bed Temp: 55  
Top/Bottom layers: 4  
Infill: 10%  
Layer Height: no more than 80% of your nozzle diameter.  Step in 0.4 increments starting at 0 for best results due to hardware constraints.  
Speed: 60 mm/s for basic.  If you are comfortable slowly increase speed each print until issues arise.  
Time To Print: 2.5 hrs  

Issues? Seems too wide, best fit is 90-90-110 x-y-z.  This is a scaling reference to the print when oriented for printing on the build plate.  
We have been adding foam or rubber weather stripping around the inner rim for comfort.  make sure it seals and has no gaps (especially at the bridge of the nose).
