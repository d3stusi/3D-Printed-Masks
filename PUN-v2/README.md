Printer settings

Nozzle Size: 0.4 mm\
Layer Height: 0.3 mm\
Infill: 0%  (if your print has issues go to 10% or 15%)
Walls: 2\
Top/Bottom Layers: 3  

Temp is material dependent, we usually print with 200C nozzle and 50C bed.

Make sure you print both the mask rivets.  Rivets are 25 pcs with 3pcs per headband.  Can also print two sets of headpiece/bands nested inside of each other. Plese do NOT change scale.
