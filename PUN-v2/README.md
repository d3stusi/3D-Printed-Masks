Printer settings

Nozzle Size: 0.4 mm\
Layer Height: 0.3 mm\
Infill: 0%  (if your print has issues go to 10% or 15%)
Walls: 2\
Top/Bottom Layers: 3  

Temp is material dependent, we usually print with 200C nozzle and 50C bed.

Make sure you print both the mask, band and rivets.  Three rivets are needed per headband.  If you want to print a few extras that would be great as they sometimes break swapping plastic shields.  Can also print two sets of headpiece/bands nested inside of each other.  

Plese do NOT change scale. Thank you for your help and contact samdurham23@gmail.com or our discord https://discord.gg/vdzRzh if you need any assistance. We generally drop off to Punahou nightly. We will organize dropoffs and supplies on discord. We can help supply you with filament if you need. We prefer white but will take any color besides black (too similar to plague mask).
