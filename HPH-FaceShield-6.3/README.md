Printer settings

Nozzle Size: 0.4 mm
Layer Height: 0.3 mm
Infill: 0% (if your print has issues go to 10% or 15%) Walls: 2
Top/Bottom Layers: 3

Temp is material dependent, we usually print with 200C nozzle and 50C bed.

Make sure you print both the face shield and the clip.  Together they make a single unit.

Plese do NOT change scale. Thank you for your help and contact samdurham23@gmail.com or our discord https://discord.gg/vdzRzh if you need any assistance. We generally drop off to Punahou nightly. We will organize dropoffs and supplies on discord. We can help supply you with filament if you need.
